# TODO_MEGA_SPRINT — Shippable scaffolds (auto)

Generated from TODO_STATUS_SCAFFOLDS.md.
This is a *do-the-whole-list* sprint file that can reach 100%.
When something is inherently provider/endpoint-dependent, we still scaffold it and mark QA separately.

## Open scaffold items
- [x] #20 **Wide monitor wall (“50-ticker view”)**
- [x] #21 Grid view (e.g., 5×10) with minimal per-ticker info
